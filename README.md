# Discord Member Logger

> A single-file Discord user tracking script with persistent storage, checkpointed history scanning, live logging, and built-in tools for searching, deduplication, and maintenance.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

- This script runs in **self-bot mode** (`self_bot=True` in `main.py`).  
- **Self-bots and user tokens are against Discord‚Äôs Terms of Service.**  
- Running this on your personal Discord account can result in **account termination**.  
- This project is provided for **educational and testing purposes only**, ideally on accounts/servers you own.  

---

## üìñ Overview

The script does the following:

- Collects **user IDs**, **usernames**, **server IDs**, and **server names**.  
- Saves data to an **SQLite database** (`users.db`).  
- Maintains **user‚Äìserver mappings**.  
- Performs **full scan** (all servers) or **targeted scan** (single server).  
- Uses **persistent checkpoints** to resume channel history scanning.  
- Discovers users from:
  - Message authors  
  - Reactions on messages  
  - Server boosters (`premium_subscribers`)  
  - Member joins  
  - Presence updates  
- Writes readable log lines into **`logs.txt`**.  
- Runs **live event tracking** after initial scan.  
- Includes **search & maintenance CLI menu** for duplicates and purging.  
- Prints a **heartbeat** every 5 minutes showing total users in DB.  

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Database Structure

`users.db` is automatically created with four tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  username TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS servers (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_servers (
  user_id TEXT,
  server_id TEXT,
  PRIMARY KEY(user_id, server_id)
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS checkpoints (
  channel_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  last_message_id TEXT
);
```

- `users` ‚Üí stores unique user IDs + usernames.  
- `servers` ‚Üí stores guild IDs + names.  
- `user_servers` ‚Üí links users to servers.  
- `checkpoints` ‚Üí tracks last processed message per channel (so scanning can resume).  

---

## üìù logs.txt

All **first-time user discoveries** are logged into `logs.txt`.  
Format:

```
2025-10-02 14:20:33,120 - ExampleUser#1234 (123456789012345678) discovered in ExampleServer --- sent message id=987654321
```

- Timestamp  
- Username + ID  
- Server name  
- Action (message, reaction, join, presence, booster)  

Duplicates may appear if the script restarts or re-discovers the same user.  
Use the maintenance menu to **check** or **deduplicate** logs.

---

## üîç Search & Maintenance Menu

At startup, choose `s` to open the CLI menu.  

Available commands:

1. **Show total unique users**  
   - Prints total count from DB.  

2. **Search user by ID or username**  
   - Search exact ID or partial name.  
   - Shows servers linked to that user.  

3. **Check duplicates in DB**  
   - Reports duplicate user IDs in `users` table.  

4. **Check duplicates in logs.txt**  
   - Reports duplicate entries in `logs.txt` by user ID.  

5. **Remove duplicates from DB**  
   - Deletes duplicate user rows.  
   - Requires typing `YES` to confirm.  

6. **Remove duplicates from logs.txt**  
   - Deduplicates log file.  
   - Keeps first occurrence per user, removes others.  
   - Requires typing `YES` to confirm.  

7. **Exit menu**  
   - Leaves the menu.  

8. **Remove user data by server ID**  
   - Purges all user‚Äìserver relationships for the given server.  
   - If a user only existed in that server ‚Üí removed completely.  
   - Removes the server entry as well.

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Run

### 1. Install Python
Requires **Python 3.9+**.  
Check with:
```bash
python --version
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```
Activate it:
- Windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate`  
- Linux/Mac: `source .venv/bin/activate`

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install discord.py python-dotenv
```

### 4. Create `.env`
In the same folder as `main.py`, create a file named `.env`:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_account_token_here
```

## üîë Getting Your Discord Account Token

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Using a user token is not allowed by Discord ToS.  
This is explained here only for technical completeness.  

1. Open Discord in your browser (desktop app doesn‚Äôt work).  
2. Press **F12** or **Ctrl+Shift+I** to open Developer Tools.  
3. Go to the **Application / Storage** tab.  
4. Expand **Local Storage** ‚Üí select `https://discord.com`.  
5. Look for the entry called **token**.  
6. Copy its value ‚Äî this is your account token.  

‚ö†Ô∏è Keep this secret. Anyone with your token has **full control** of your account.  

---

## üöÄ Running the Script

Run:
```bash
python main.py
```

On login, you‚Äôll see a mode selector:

```
Mode: 1 ‚Üí Target server scan + live
      2 ‚Üí All servers scan + live
      s ‚Üí search tools
>
```

- `1` ‚Üí Scans one server (asks for server ID).  
- `2` ‚Üí Scans all servers.  
- `s` ‚Üí Opens search/maintenance menu.  

---

## üîí Anti-Duplication

### Built-in
- Uses database **unique constraints** (`PRIMARY KEY`, `INSERT OR IGNORE`) to prevent duplicate entries.  
- Logs only record **first discovery** of each user.  

### Cleanup Tools
- **DB cleanup** ‚Üí Menu option 5 (removes duplicate DB rows).  
- **Logs cleanup** ‚Üí Menu option 6 (deduplicates `logs.txt`).  

---

## üìÇ Files Created

- **`main.py`** ‚Üí the script.  
- **`users.db`** ‚Üí SQLite DB (auto-created).  
- **`logs.txt`** ‚Üí append-only discovery log.  
- **`.env`** ‚Üí must contain your token.  

---

## üí° Example Workflow

1. Run script ‚Üí choose **Full Scan (2)**.  
2. Wait for scan to complete ‚Üí live tracking starts.  
3. Stop script, then restart later ‚Üí it resumes from **checkpoints**.  
4. To check total users ‚Üí restart script, choose **Search Menu (s)**, then option **1**.  
5. To clean duplicate logs ‚Üí option **4** then **6**.  
6. To purge a server ‚Üí option **8**, enter server ID.  

---

## üîê Security Notes

- `users.db` and `logs.txt` contain **user IDs and usernames** ‚Üí handle as sensitive data.  
- Never share your `.env` file or token.  
- Use **search menu option 8** to remove all records for a specific server if needed.
