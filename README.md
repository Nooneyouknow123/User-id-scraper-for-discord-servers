# Discord Member Logger

> A single-file Discord user tracking script with persistent storage, checkpointed history scanning, live logging, and built-in tools for searching, deduplication, and maintenance.
> Your self-bot account has to be in targetted server(s).

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

* This script runs in **self-bot mode** (`self_bot=True` in `main.py`).
* **Self-bots and user tokens are against Discord‚Äôs Terms of Service.**
* Running this on your personal Discord account can result in **account termination**.
* This project is provided for **educational and testing purposes only**, ideally on accounts/servers you own.

---

## üìñ Overview

The script does the following:

* Collects **user IDs**, **usernames**, **server IDs**, and **server names**.
* Saves data to an **SQLite database** (`users.db`).
* Maintains **user‚Äìserver mappings**.
* Performs **full scan** (all servers) or **targeted scan** (single server).
* Uses **persistent checkpoints** to resume channel history scanning.
* Discovers users from:

  * Message authors
  * Reactions on messages
  * Server boosters (`premium_subscribers`)
  * Member joins
  * Presence updates
* Writes readable log lines into **`logs.txt`**.
* Runs **live event tracking** after initial scan.
* Includes **search & maintenance CLI menu** for duplicates and purging.
* Prints a **heartbeat** every 5 minutes showing total users in DB.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Database Structure

`users.db` is automatically created with four tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  username TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS servers (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_servers (
  user_id TEXT,
  server_id TEXT,
  PRIMARY KEY(user_id, server_id)
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS checkpoints (
  channel_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  last_message_id TEXT
);
```

* `users` ‚Üí stores unique user IDs + usernames.
* `servers` ‚Üí stores guild IDs + names.
* `user_servers` ‚Üí links users to servers.
* `checkpoints` ‚Üí tracks last processed message per channel (so scanning can resume).

---

## üìù logs.txt

All **first-time user discoveries** are logged into `logs.txt`.
Format:

```
2025-10-02 14:20:33,120 - ExampleUser#1234 (123456789012345678) discovered in ExampleServer --- sent message id=987654321
```

* Timestamp
* Username + ID
* Server name
* Action (message, reaction, join, presence, booster)

Duplicates may appear if the script restarts or re-discovers the same user.
Use the maintenance menu to **check** or **deduplicate** logs.

> **Note (added):** Create a `logs.txt` file in the same folder as `main.py` before running the script so you can immediately see appended logs. If `logs.txt` is missing the script will attempt to write to it, but creating it beforehand avoids permission or path issues.

---

## üîç Search & Maintenance Menu

At startup, choose `s` to open the CLI menu.

Available commands:

1. **Show total unique users**

   * Prints total count from DB.

2. **Search user by ID or username**

   * Search exact ID or partial name.
   * Shows servers linked to that user.

3. **Check duplicates in DB**

   * Reports duplicate user IDs in `users` table.

4. **Check duplicates in logs.txt**

   * Reports duplicate entries in `logs.txt` by user ID.

5. **Remove duplicates from DB**

   * Deletes duplicate user rows.
   * Requires typing `YES` to confirm.

6. **Remove duplicates from logs.txt**

   * Deduplicates log file.
   * Keeps first occurrence per user, removes others.
   * Requires typing `YES` to confirm.

7. **Exit menu**

   * Leaves the menu.

8. **Remove user data by server ID**

   * Purges all user‚Äìserver relationships for the given server.
   * If a user only existed in that server ‚Üí removed completely.
   * Removes the server entry as well.

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Run

### 1. Install Python

Requires **Python 3.9+**.
Check with:

```bash
python --version
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate it:

* Windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
* Linux/Mac: `source .venv/bin/activate`

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install discord.py python-dotenv
```

> **Note (added):** This project requires the **latest version of `discord.py-self`** (a fork that supports self-bot usage). If you want to run the script in self-bot mode, install or upgrade that library first:
>
> ```bash
> pip install -U discord.py-self
> ```
>
> Keep in mind `discord.py-self` is an unofficial library and using it with a user token violates Discord's Terms of Service.

### 4. Create `.env`

In the same folder as `main.py`, create a file named `.env`:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_account_token_here
```

> **Alternative format (added):** Some users prefer to write the token with spaces around the equals sign. The script's `.env` parser accepts either format, but to follow the added instruction exactly you can write:
>
> ```
> DISCORD_TOKEN = your_token_here
> ```
>
> Make sure there are no surrounding quotes unless your parser expects them. **Never** commit `.env` to version control.

## üîë Getting Your Discord Account Token

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Using a user token is not allowed by Discord ToS.
This is explained here only for technical completeness.

1. Open Discord in your browser (desktop app doesn‚Äôt work).
2. Press **F12** or **Ctrl+Shift+I** to open Developer Tools.
3. Go to the **Application / Storage** tab.
4. Expand **Local Storage** ‚Üí select `https://discord.com`.
5. Look for the entry called **token**.
6. Copy its value ‚Äî this is your account token.

‚ö†Ô∏è Keep this secret. Anyone with your token has **full control** of your account.

---

## üöÄ Running the Script

Run:

```bash
python main.py
```

On login, you‚Äôll see a mode selector:

```
Mode: 1 ‚Üí Target server scan + live
      2 ‚Üí All servers scan + live
      s ‚Üí search tools
>
```

* `1` ‚Üí Scans one server (asks for server ID).
* `2` ‚Üí Scans all servers.
* `s` ‚Üí Opens search/maintenance menu.

---

## üîí Anti-Duplication

### Built-in

* Uses database **unique constraints** (`PRIMARY KEY`, `INSERT OR IGNORE`) to prevent duplicate entries.
* Logs only record **first discovery** of each user.

### Cleanup Tools

* **DB cleanup** ‚Üí Menu option 5 (removes duplicate DB rows).
* **Logs cleanup** ‚Üí Menu option 6 (deduplicates `logs.txt`).

---

## üìÇ Files Created

* **`main.py`** ‚Üí the script.
* **`users.db`** ‚Üí SQLite DB (auto-created).
* **`logs.txt`** ‚Üí append-only discovery log.
* **`.env`** ‚Üí must contain your token.

> **Note (added):** SQL database files (`users.db` and any other SQLite files the script uses) will be **automatically created** the first time you run the script; you do not need to create them manually.

---

## üí° Example Workflow

1. Run script ‚Üí choose **Full Scan (2)**.
2. Wait for scan to complete ‚Üí live tracking starts.
3. Stop script, then restart later ‚Üí it resumes from **checkpoints**.
4. To check total users ‚Üí restart script, choose **Search Menu (s)**, then option **1**.
5. To clean duplicate logs ‚Üí option **4** then **6**.
6. To purge a server ‚Üí option **8**, enter server ID.

---

## üîê Security Notes

* `users.db` and `logs.txt` contain **user IDs and usernames** ‚Üí handle as sensitive data.
* Never share your `.env` file or token.
* Use **search menu option 8** to remove all records for a specific server if needed.
